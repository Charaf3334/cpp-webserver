zakaria - cgi
    4- old promo: QUERY_STRING
    6- Add CGI pipes to your epoll set - Handle them asynchronously with other connections
    7- i should build a default working cgi files in cgi files final

    to charaf:
    zedt addr and port frequest
    added extra headers to build response so i can set the cookies,
    if epoll is fixed for both get and post, you must explain it to me because i need to implement it in cgi too (time out user, time out script)
